# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security policy for the STM32 ROS2 Robot Control project. As an embedded robotics system with network communication capabilities, security considerations are crucial for safe operation.

## üìã Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                | Beta/Development versions |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **Unencrypted Communication**: This system uses UDP communication without encryption
- **Network Exposure**: Direct Ethernet connections expose the device to network-based attacks
- **Default Credentials**: No authentication mechanism is implemented by default

### Physical Security
- **Hardware Access**: Physical access to the STM32 board allows firmware modification
- **Debug Interfaces**: ST-Link and JTAG interfaces provide low-level access
- **Servo Control**: Unauthorized commands could cause physical damage or injury

### Firmware Security
- **Code Injection**: Malformed ROS2 messages could potentially cause buffer overflows
- **Memory Safety**: C/C++ implementation requires careful memory management
- **Flash Protection**: No firmware integrity verification by default

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What to Report

Please report security issues related to:
- **Network Communication Vulnerabilities**
  - Buffer overflows in UDP packet handling
  - Denial of service attacks
  - Unauthorized command execution
- **Firmware Security Issues**
  - Memory corruption vulnerabilities
  - Code injection possibilities
  - Privilege escalation
- **Hardware Security Concerns**
  - Debug interface exploitation
  - Flash memory protection bypasses
  - Side-channel attacks
- **Robot Safety Issues**
  - Servo control bypass mechanisms
  - Emergency stop failures
  - Unsafe servo movements

### How to Report

**For Security Issues:**
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [MAINTAINER_EMAIL]
3. Include "STM32 ROS2 Security" in the subject line
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

**Required Information:**
- Vulnerability description
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Hardware/software configuration used
- Network setup details

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Security Advisory**: Within 2 weeks (if confirmed)
- **Patch Release**: Timeline depends on severity

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Network Security
- **Isolated Networks**: Use dedicated networks for robot communication
- **Firewall Rules**: Implement firewall rules to restrict access
- **VPN Access**: Consider VPN for remote access scenarios
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### Physical Security
- **Restricted Access**: Limit physical access to the hardware
- **Debug Interface Protection**: Disable debug interfaces in production
- **Enclosure Security**: Use tamper-evident enclosures
- **Emergency Stops**: Implement hardware emergency stop mechanisms

### Firmware Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming ROS2 messages
- **Memory Protection**: Use memory protection mechanisms where available
- **Secure Boot**: Consider implementing secure boot mechanisms
- **Regular Updates**: Keep firmware updated with latest security patches

### Operational Security
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls
- **Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging for security events
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system behavior for anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan ready

## üîß Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

**Network Configuration:**
```c
// Limit UDP packet size to prevent buffer overflows
#define MAX_UDP_PACKET_SIZE 1024

// Implement rate limiting
#define MAX_COMMANDS_PER_SECOND 10

// Add command validation
bool validateServoCommand(const char* command) {
    // Implement strict command validation
    return true;
}
```

**Hardware Security:**
- Disable unused debug interfaces
- Enable flash read protection where possible
- Use hardware watchdog timers
- Implement brown-out detection

### Development Security

**Code Review Requirements:**
- All network communication code must be reviewed
- Memory allocation/deallocation must be audited
- Input validation functions require special attention
- Security-sensitive changes need maintainer approval

**Testing Requirements:**
- Fuzz testing for network inputs
- Memory safety testing with Valgrind or similar
- Penetration testing for network interfaces
- Hardware security testing

## üö´ Known Security Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Authentication**: System accepts commands from any source
2. **No Encryption**: All communication is in plaintext
3. **No Authorization**: No role-based access control
4. **Limited Input Validation**: Basic command validation only
5. **No Secure Boot**: Firmware integrity not verified at boot

### Future Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement command authentication
- [ ] Add TLS/DTLS encryption support
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Enhanced input validation
- [ ] Secure boot implementation
- [ ] Hardware security module integration
